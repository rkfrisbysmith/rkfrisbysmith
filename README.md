# 🌿 AI-Powered Tomato Leaf Disease Detection
Using computer vision to identify diseases in tomato plants through image analysis

📌 Overview

This project explores how Artificial Intelligence, particularly computer vision techniques, can be applied to agriculture by analyzing images of tomato leaves. By detecting color patterns and anomalies in leaf images, we aim to identify signs of plant diseases early, helping farmers take timely action.

🧠 AI Focus: Vision in AI

Our work falls under the "Vision in AI" category, leveraging image data and machine learning models to automate the identification of disease symptoms based on visible patterns and discoloration in leaves.

🔍 Problem Statement

Tomato plants are prone to a variety of diseases, many of which cause visible changes in the color and texture of their leaves. Manual identification is time-consuming and often inaccurate. Our goal is to build a system that can:
- Automatically classify tomato leaf images as healthy or diseased
- Detect specific diseases based on leaf color changes
- Improve efficiency in crop monitoring using AI
